## About the project

ArduCar is my first car robot ever built! 
It is basically a semi automated car that follows black colored tape track. To follow that path it uses the two ir sensor that detect when the car is following a wrong direction. 
If the ir signal doesn't return to the sensor, arduino makes the car turn either right or left. 
So the color black of the tape is not random; 
It is a color that absorbs the ir radiations.


## What is it made of?

ArduCar can be seen as a really simple robot and it is.
However not only I wanted to experiment with arduino but also I wanted to build a really simple PCB and a case that could make ArduCar cooler.

All the code has been written using vs code and the arduino extension. It is really simple.

The PCB has been made using a web app called EasyEDA, a very user firendly tool for designing your circuits. It was my first time making a circuit on a pcb so apologies my "creative" of doing things :)
Besides those imperfections, It works perfectly as I wanted to.

Finally too make the mechanics I used Fusion360, this design is actually my second iteration after this one:

So after some adjustments I made it more pleasable to the eye and this is my attempt!

This is the top part

And this is the bottom one

the 3d parts have been printed with my wonderful Ender 3.

Thank you for taking your time viewing this project!
